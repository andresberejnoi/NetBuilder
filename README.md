The neural network class is in NeuralNet.py. 
It allows to easily create fully connected feedforward networks of
any size allowed by available memory. It uses numpy arrays as the primary
data structure for the weight matrices. 
With this package you can create deep neural networks very quickly.

Package can be installed with pip:

$ pip install netbuilder
